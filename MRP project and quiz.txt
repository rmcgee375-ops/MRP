Please give a short tutorial on material requirements planning

Sure! Here’s a short, practical tutorial on Material Requirements Planning (MRP)—no jargon overload, just the essentials.

What is MRP?
Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is a system used in manufacturing to figure out what materials you need, how much you need, and when you need them so production runs smoothly.
Think of it as: “Don’t order too early, don’t order too late, and don’t order too much.”

The 3 Core Inputs
MRP relies on three key pieces of information:


Master Production Schedule (MPS)
What finished products you plan to make, and when.


Bill of Materials (BOM)
A “recipe” for each product—lists all parts, components, and quantities needed.


Inventory Records
What you already have on hand, what’s on order, and lead times for each item.



How MRP Works (Step by Step)


Start with demand
From the MPS, determine how many finished products are needed per time period.


Explode the BOM
Break each product into required components (and sub-components).


Check inventory
Subtract what’s already in stock or scheduled to arrive.


Account for lead times
Move requirements backward in time so materials arrive right when needed.


Generate planned orders
Create purchase orders or production orders for materials.



Simple Example
You want to build 100 bicycles next month.


Each bicycle needs:


2 wheels


1 frame




You have:


120 wheels in stock


20 frames in stock




MRP calculation:


Wheels needed: 200 − 120 = 80 wheels to order


Frames needed: 100 − 20 = 80 frames to order


If wheels take 2 weeks to arrive, MRP schedules the order 2 weeks before production.



Key Benefits


Reduces excess inventory 📉


Prevents stockouts 🚫


Improves production scheduling ⏱️


Lowers overall costs 💰



Common Limitations


Requires accurate data (bad data = bad plans)


Doesn’t handle sudden demand changes well


Traditional MRP doesn’t consider capacity constraints



MRP vs. ERP (Quick Note)


MRP → Focused on materials & production planning


ERP → MRP + finance, HR, sales, logistics, and more



If you want, I can:


Walk through a spreadsheet-style MRP example


Explain MRP vs JIT vs Kanban


Show how MRP is used in real companies or ERP systems (SAP, Oracle, etc.)



Just say the word 🙂
Here is how it is used in real companies.

Absolutely—let’s ground MRP in the real world. Here’s how actual companies use Material Requirements Planning day to day, across different industries.

1. Automotive Manufacturing (e.g., Toyota, Ford)
What they make: Cars with ~30,000 parts
How MRP is used:

MRP starts from the vehicle production schedule (e.g., 1,200 cars/day).

BOMs explode into engines, seats, wiring harnesses, chips, bolts, etc.

Lead times vary wildly:

Chips: months

Seats: days

MRP schedules orders so parts arrive just before assembly.

Real impact:

Prevents line stoppages (which can cost millions per hour).

Coordinates thousands of suppliers across the globe.

Reality check:
Automakers often combine MRP + Just-in-Time (JIT). MRP plans what and when; JIT controls how much is physically delivered.

2. Electronics & Hardware (e.g., Apple, Dell)
What they make: Phones, laptops, servers
How MRP is used:

Demand forecasts feed the Master Production Schedule.

BOMs include processors, screens, batteries, and tiny components.

MRP highlights long-lead items (chips, displays) early.

Planners run “what-if” scenarios:

What if demand spikes 20%?

What if a supplier is late?

Real impact:

Helps lock in scarce components months in advance.

Reduces last-minute expediting costs.

Reality check:
MRP plans centrally, but final assembly may be delayed until customer orders are firm (a postponement strategy).

3. Consumer Packaged Goods (e.g., Procter & Gamble, Unilever)
What they make: Shampoo, detergent, food products
How MRP is used:

MPS driven by promotions and seasonal demand.

BOMs include raw ingredients, packaging, labels.

MRP synchronizes:

Chemicals

Bottles

Caps

Cartons

Real impact:

Avoids situations like having product but no packaging.

Supports high-volume, repetitive production.

Reality check:
Shelf life matters—MRP must respect expiration dates and lot sizes.

4. Aerospace & Defense (e.g., Boeing, Lockheed Martin)
What they make: Aircraft, satellites, defense systems
How MRP is used:

Extremely deep BOMs (thousands of levels).

Long production cycles (years, not weeks).

MRP tracks serialized parts and compliance requirements.

Real impact:

Ensures regulatory traceability.

Coordinates suppliers for one-off or low-volume builds.

Reality check:
Here, MRP is tightly integrated with project management and engineering change control.

5. Small & Mid-Size Manufacturers
What they make: Furniture, machinery, custom products
How MRP is used:

Often implemented via ERP systems like:

NetSuite

SAP Business One

Odoo

Weekly or daily MRP runs generate:

Purchase orders

Work orders

Planners manually adjust for reality (rush orders, late vendors).

Real impact:

Big jump in visibility and fewer “surprise shortages.”

Enables scaling without chaos.

What MRP Looks Like in Practice
In real companies, MRP usually means:

A planner reviewing exception messages:

“Order is late”

“Shortage detected”

Adjusting dates, quantities, or suppliers

Coordinating with:

Purchasing

Production

Sales

It’s less “set and forget” and more decision support.

Big Takeaway
MRP isn’t about perfection—it’s about seeing problems early.

Companies that win with MRP:

Keep BOMs and inventory accurate

Respect lead times

Combine MRP with human judgment
