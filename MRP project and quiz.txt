Please give a short tutorial on material requirements planning

Sure! Here’s a short, practical tutorial on Material Requirements Planning (MRP)—no jargon overload, just the essentials.

What is MRP?
Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is a system used in manufacturing to figure out what materials you need, how much you need, and when you need them so production runs smoothly.
Think of it as: “Don’t order too early, don’t order too late, and don’t order too much.”

The 3 Core Inputs
MRP relies on three key pieces of information:


Master Production Schedule (MPS)
What finished products you plan to make, and when.


Bill of Materials (BOM)
A “recipe” for each product—lists all parts, components, and quantities needed.


Inventory Records
What you already have on hand, what’s on order, and lead times for each item.



How MRP Works (Step by Step)


Start with demand
From the MPS, determine how many finished products are needed per time period.


Explode the BOM
Break each product into required components (and sub-components).


Check inventory
Subtract what’s already in stock or scheduled to arrive.


Account for lead times
Move requirements backward in time so materials arrive right when needed.


Generate planned orders
Create purchase orders or production orders for materials.



Simple Example
You want to build 100 bicycles next month.


Each bicycle needs:


2 wheels


1 frame




You have:


120 wheels in stock


20 frames in stock




MRP calculation:


Wheels needed: 200 − 120 = 80 wheels to order


Frames needed: 100 − 20 = 80 frames to order


If wheels take 2 weeks to arrive, MRP schedules the order 2 weeks before production.



Key Benefits


Reduces excess inventory 📉


Prevents stockouts 🚫


Improves production scheduling ⏱️


Lowers overall costs 💰



Common Limitations


Requires accurate data (bad data = bad plans)


Doesn’t handle sudden demand changes well


Traditional MRP doesn’t consider capacity constraints



MRP vs. ERP (Quick Note)


MRP → Focused on materials & production planning


ERP → MRP + finance, HR, sales, logistics, and more
